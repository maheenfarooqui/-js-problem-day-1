# 🚀 JavaScript Problem Solving – Day 1

This repository contains beginner-level JavaScript problems to build logic and problem-solving skills through simple examples using loops, conditions, and math concepts.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Printing numbers (1 → N and N → 1)
- Even & odd numbers
- Sum of natural numbers
- Factorials
- Mathematical formulas for optimization
- Squares of numbers

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Difference between **O(n)** and **O(1)** time complexity  
- How to use `for` loops efficiently  
- Using formulas like `n*(n+1)/2` for instant results  
- DOM manipulation for taking input and showing output  

## 🧰 Homework
1. Print all numbers divisible by 3 and 5 up to N  
2. Find sum of all odd numbers up to N  
3. Print cubes of numbers from 1 to N  
4. Print even numbers that are also perfect squares
